Deploy your application to the cluster with a single command.

## Usage

```bash
atlas deploy
```

## What Happens

1. **Build** — Creates a Docker image from your project
2. **Push** — Uploads to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
3. **Deploy** — Triggers the Control Panel API to update the cluster
4. **DNS** — Configures Cloudflare DNS records automatically
5. **HTTPS** — cert-manager provisions Let's Encrypt certificates

## Options

```bash
atlas deploy --host root@server    # Legacy: deploy via SSH directly
```

## How It Works

When you run `atlas deploy`, the CLI:

1. Reads your `atlas.yaml` to determine services
2. Builds Docker images for each service
3. Pushes images to `ghcr.io/your-org/your-project`
4. Calls `POST /deploys/project/:id` on the Control Panel
5. The Panel SSHs into the server and runs `kubectl set image`
6. Waits for rollout to complete
7. Creates/updates DNS records via Cloudflare API

## Requirements

- `atlas.yaml` in your project root
- Authenticated via `atlas login`
- Control Panel configured via `atlas panel setup`
