Authenticate the CLI with your Atlas Control Panel via GitHub OAuth.

## Usage

```bash
atlas login
```

## What Happens

1. Opens your browser to GitHub's OAuth authorization page
2. After you authorize, GitHub redirects to a local callback server
3. The CLI exchanges the code for a JWT token
4. Token is stored locally in `~/.atlas/config.json`

## Token Storage

Credentials are saved at:

```
~/.atlas/config.json
```

The token is a JWT with 30-day expiry, signed with HMAC-SHA256.

## Re-authentication

Run `atlas login` again to refresh your token. The old token is overwritten.
