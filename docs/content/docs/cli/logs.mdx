Stream logs from your running services.

## Usage

```bash
atlas logs [service] -f
```

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-f, --follow` | Stream logs continuously |
| `--tail N` | Number of recent lines (default: 100) |
| `--service NAME` | Target a specific service |

## Examples

```bash
# Stream all logs
atlas logs -f

# Last 50 lines from the API service
atlas logs api --tail 50

# Follow logs from a specific service
atlas logs worker -f
```

## How It Works

Logs are streamed via **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** from the Control Panel API:

1. CLI calls `GET /logs/project/:id?service=X`
2. Panel SSHs into the server
3. Runs `kubectl logs` with the appropriate flags
4. Streams output back to the CLI in real-time
