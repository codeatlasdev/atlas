The `atlas panel` commands manage your Control Panel — the central API that orchestrates everything.

## Setup

Connect the CLI to your Control Panel:

```bash
atlas panel setup
```

You'll be prompted for the Panel API URL (e.g., `https://panel.yourdomain.com`).

## Status

View servers and projects managed by the Panel:

```bash
atlas panel status
```

## Config

Interactive configuration for integrations:

```bash
atlas panel config
```

Options:
- **GitHub App** — Creates a GitHub App via the Manifest flow (opens browser, automatic)
- **Cloudflare** — Set your Cloudflare API token for DNS automation

## Server Management

### Add a server

```bash
atlas panel server add --host root@your-server.com --name production
```

This registers the server with the Panel and optionally provisions it with the full stack (K3s, Traefik, cert-manager, monitoring).

### List servers

```bash
atlas panel server list
```

Shows all registered servers with their status, resources, and health.
