This guide takes you from a fresh install to a live application.

## Prerequisites

- Atlas CLI [installed](/docs/getting-started/installation)
- A VPS with SSH access (any provider — Hetzner, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)
- A domain with Cloudflare DNS

## 1. Authenticate

```bash
atlas login
```

This opens your browser for GitHub OAuth. After authenticating, the CLI stores your token locally.

## 2. Set Up the Control Panel

The Control Panel is the brain of Atlas. It manages deployments, DNS, secrets, and servers.

```bash
atlas panel setup
```

Follow the prompts to connect to your Panel API.

## 3. Configure Integrations

```bash
atlas panel config
```

This interactive menu lets you configure:
- **GitHub App** — for container registry access (automatic via Manifest flow)
- **Cloudflare** — for DNS automation

## 4. Provision a Server

Point Atlas at any fresh Linux server:

```bash
atlas panel server add --host root@your-server.com --name production
```

Atlas will SSH into the server and install:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| K3s | Lightweight Kubernetes |
| Traefik v3 | Ingress + HTTPS redirect |
| cert-manager | Let's Encrypt certificates |
| Prometheus + Grafana | Metrics + dashboards |
| Loki + Alloy | Centralized logs |
| ArgoCD | GitOps deployment |

## 5. Deploy

Navigate to your project and deploy:

```bash
cd your-project
atlas deploy
```

Atlas will:
1. Build a Docker image
2. Push to GitHub Container Registry
3. Deploy to your cluster
4. Configure DNS via Cloudflare
5. Provision HTTPS via Let's Encrypt

Your app is live. 🎉
