description: What is Atlas and why it exists

Atlas is an open-source **Internal Developer Platform (IDP)** that turns any Linux server into a production-ready cluster. Developers write code — Atlas handles the rest.

## The Problem

Deploying applications shouldn't require expertise in Kubernetes, DNS, SSL certificates, Docker, or CI/CD pipelines. Yet most teams spend weeks configuring infrastructure before shipping a single feature.

Platforms like Heroku and Vercel solved this — but at a cost. You're locked into their infrastructure, their pricing, their limits.

## The Solution

Atlas gives you the same developer experience on **your own servers**. Any VPS — Hetzner, DigitalOcean, AWS, bare metal — becomes a fully managed platform with one command.

```bash
atlas deploy   # that's it
```

**What the developer never touches:**

- Kubernetes manifests
- Dockerfiles
- DNS records
- SSL certificates
- Secrets management
- Server provisioning
- CI/CD pipelines

## How It Works

Atlas reads an `atlas.yaml` in your project root:

```yaml
name: myapp
services:
  api:
    type: api
    port: 3001
    domain: api.myapp.com
  web:
    type: web
    domain: myapp.com

infra:
  postgres: true
  redis: true
```

From this single file, Atlas:

1. **Builds** Docker images for each service
2. **Pushes** to your container registry
3. **Deploys** to your Kubernetes cluster
4. **Configures DNS** automatically via Cloudflare
5. **Provisions HTTPS** via Let's Encrypt
6. **Manages secrets** encrypted at rest

## Architecture

```

The **Control Panel** is the central brain. The CLI and future Web UI are just clients. Every action flows through the Panel API.
